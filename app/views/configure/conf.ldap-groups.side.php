<h1>Information</h1>

<p>Use this page to retrieve the user groups from your LDAP server so you can automatically assign LDAP users in their groups to a single group and multiple departments within Classroombookings. This only needs to be done on first configuration and if you change your LDAP groups.</p>
<p>This will use the settings you configured in the <em>Authentication</em> tab, but you must supply a username and password here that has the appropriate permissions to retrieve all the groups.</p>
